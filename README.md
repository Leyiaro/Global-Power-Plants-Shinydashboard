# Global-Power-Plants-Shinydashboard

This shiny dashboard project visualizes WRI Global Power Plant dataset (Version 1.3) obtained from https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase 

### About WRI dataset

The World Resources Institute (WRI) developed an open-source database of global power plants containing information on around 35,000 facilities located in 167 countries. An extensive explanation of the dataset's content is available in the data source provided.

Two datasets, `Population` and `continents`, were incorporated into the project to provide global and countries-level analytics.


### Key attributes of the dashboard

At the global level, an interactive plot was created to show energy sources, how reliant countries are on the given energy source, and visuals of regions and sub-regions energy mixes. At the country level, the project provides visuals on energy mix based on estimated generated power in GWH

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive view of energy sources globally and at the country level, at different levels of detail, for a better understanding of energy resources and reliance.
